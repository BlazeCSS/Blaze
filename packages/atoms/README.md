## Installing the JavaScript Components

Link to it by adding the following to your `<head></head>`.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@blaze/atoms@x.x.x/dist/blaze-atoms.js"></script>
```

The `x.x.x` is the specific version of the library, you should use specifc versions to prevent against breaking changes.

That's it! Start using the components in your HTML.

### Integrating with a Framework

Blaze uses [Stencil](http://stenciljs.com/) to compile our components into Web Components. And since they can be used within frameworks or in standard HTML websites the best resource to read is the [Stencil documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) regarding framework integration.
